# Actual TODO; things to fix

1. Volumeicon doesn't work out of the box, now that my renderer is vulkan-intel instead of xf86-intel...
  - Maybe it's just a config error?

2. vulkan-intel produces diagonal tearing and strange yellow-ish artifacts when changing workspaces

# Things I want to do for fun with my dotfiles

1. Find a way to make these more useful and portable
2. Produce a subset of these dotfiles which is less offensive to everyone who has ever used a Unix system
3. Find a way to make Termite change my color scheme
4. Try out Wayland?
5. Re-visit .xinitrc

# Things I should do that aren't fun and are definitely inconvenient

1. Shuffle through package lists for packages to remove
2. Find a better way to handle inclusion of plug.vim
  - maybe a wget script that grabs it?
