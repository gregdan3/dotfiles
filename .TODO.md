# Actual TODO; things to fix

1. vulkan-intel produces diagonal tearing artifacts when changing workspaces or collapsing windows

# Things I want to do for fun with my dotfiles

1. Find a way to make these more useful and portable
2. Produce a subset of these dotfiles which is less offensive to everyone who has ever used a Unix system
3. Find a way to make Termite change my color scheme more quickly
4. Try out Wayland?

# Things I should do that aren't fun and are definitely inconvenient

1. Find a better way to handle inclusion of plug.vim
  - maybe a wget script that grabs it?
